# Analysis of Code Smell and Refactoring

## About

This repository contains the code used to analyze the relationship between code smells and refactoring over various version releases. Most of the code is written in Python for data analysis and visualization.

## Running the Code

1. Create a python virtual environment via the command `python3 -m venv venv`
2. Activate the virtual environment via the command `source venv/Scripts/activate`. (Note that depending on your operating system, the command may be different. For example, on Windows, the command is `venv\Scripts\activate.bat`. For more information, see [this page](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)).
3. Install the required packages via the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`
